## Generations

The BMW i3 has had one generation with several updates throughout its production run:

- **First Generation (2013-2022)**: The BMW i3 was BMW's first mass-produced zero-emissions vehicle, featuring a revolutionary design with a carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) passenger cell mounted on an aluminum chassis. The initial model launched with a 22 kWh battery providing around 81 miles (130 km) of range, with an optional range extender (REx) adding a small gasoline engine to generate electricity and extend range. 

  - **2017 Update**: Battery capacity increased to 33 kWh, extending range to approximately 114 miles (183 km).
  
  - **2019 Update**: Battery further upgraded to 42.2 kWh, providing around 153 miles (246 km) of range. Styling updates and additional features were also introduced.

  The i3 featured a distinctive interior made with sustainable materials, including dashboard components made from renewable raw materials and seats made from recycled plastic bottles. Its unique design included rear-hinged "suicide doors" for rear passenger access. The i3 was discontinued in 2022 as BMW shifted their electric vehicle strategy toward more mainstream designs.
