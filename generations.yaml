The distinctive design featured a tall, narrow body with coach doors, large windows, and a floating dashboard design with sustainable interior materials. Initially launched with a 22 kWh battery (60 Ah) providing approximately 80-100 miles of range, the i3 was available as a pure electric vehicle or with an optional small gasoline range extender engine (REx). Production began in September 2013."
