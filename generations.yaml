    description: "The BMW i3 was a groundbreaking electric vehicle that pioneered BMW's dedicated 'i' sub-brand. Built around a purpose-designed architecture featuring a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) passenger cell mounted on an aluminum chassis, the i3 prioritized lightweight construction to maximize efficiency and range. The distinctive design featured a tall, narrow body with coach doors, large windows, and a floating dashboard design with sustainable interior materials. Initially launched with a 22 kWh battery providing approximately 80-100 miles of range, the i3 was available as a pure electric vehicle or with an optional small gasoline range extender engine (REx). Updates in 2017 (33 kWh battery) and 2019 (42.2 kWh battery) increased range to up to 153 miles. Throughout its lifecycle, motor power increased from 170 HP to 184 HP in later models. The i3 featured innovative technologies including a heat pump climate control system for efficiency and early iterations of BMW's driver assistance systems. Despite modest sales compared to mainstream BMW models, the i3 was significant in advancing electric vehicle technology and sustainable manufacturing processes. Its unique approach to design, materials, and engineering made it a distinctive product in BMW's lineup and the broader electric vehicle market before production ended in August 2022."
